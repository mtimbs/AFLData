This data is free for personal use. If you do anything cool with it and want me to share it in this repo then send me a message on twitter @michael_timbs and i'll link to your blog/work.

If you find any errors/mistakes in the data please let me know via Github issues or submit a pull request with the fix.

## Notes on Data
2012 Data does not break down disposals into Contested/Uncontested possessions. From 2013 onwards this data is available. When training models you will need to determine whether the breakdown of posessions into contested/uncontested split is more valuable than having the extra training data from 2012. (If you do any investigation into this and want to share the results, I'll link them here). Otherwise you can ignore those match statistics for 2013-2019 and look at overall Disposals as a model parameter.

I can't remember why I didn't record this data, it either wasn't available at the time or I just didn't think to record it. If you have the data and can be bothered adding it into the database, a pull request with the update would be greatly appreciated.
